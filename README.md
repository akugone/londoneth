# SWAGGI : Super We All Gonna Give It

Swaggi started at ETHDenver, inspired by seeing a friend struggle to pack too much hackathon swag. We realized the waste wasn't uniqueâ€”too often, event goodies are discarded or forgotten.

That's where Swaggi steps in. It's a simple, friendly platform that helps event organizers and companies send their extra swag to charities. With SWAGGI (Super We All Gonna Give It), we're turning leftovers into lifelines. Companies get a "Proof Of Give" NFT for their donations, creating a circle of giving and impact. They are then able to share a public page with all the infos about donations.

In short, SWAGGI transforms surplus into support, making sure no swag goes to waste and helping those in need.

## Partners

### Chiliz

We deployed our smart contract on Chiliz and create a token call PoG. The goal is to incentive donators to give to charity and get a reward in return. We also use the Chiliz blockchain to store the hash of the donation and the hash of the proof of the donation.
Unfortunately, we didn't manage to run the local graph node to use the full capacity of Chiliz with our Dapp

### NounsDao

NounsDAO: The visual identity and user interface of our platform have been significantly enhanced by utilizing the assets from NounsDAO. By incorporating their distinctive and creative designs into our website's design and front-end, we've managed to create an engaging and visually appealing environment.

### WorldCoin

WorldCoin: To ensure the authenticity and security of user interactions on Swaggi when a user want to make a donation.
