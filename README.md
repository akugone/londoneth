## Partners

### Chiliz

We deployed our smart contract on Chiliz and create a token call PoG. The goal is to incentive donators to give to charity and get a reward in return. We also use the Chiliz blockchain to store the hash of the donation and the hash of the proof of the donation.
Unfortunately, we didn't manage to run the local graph node to use the full capacity of Chiliz with our Dapp

### NounsDao

NounsDAO: The visual identity and user interface of our platform have been significantly enhanced by utilizing the assets from NounsDAO. By incorporating their distinctive and creative designs into our website's design and front-end, we've managed to create an engaging and visually appealing environment.

### WorldCoin

WorldCoin: To ensure the authenticity and security of user interactions on Swaggi when a user want to make a donation.
